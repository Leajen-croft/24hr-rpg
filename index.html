                        <p>Itâ€™s time for our 4th 24 hour RPG challenge!</p>
                        <p>This year our chosen charity is Mind. Mind is a mental health charity that helps to raise awareness for mental health and provides support to those who need help. We have chosen to support Mind due to the ongoing stigma surrounding mental health and because we believe everyone knows someone who has been affected by mental health problems, whether that be depression, anxiety, addiction, or some other mental condition.</p>
                        <p>Like last year we will be running multiple RPG adventures simultaneously for a full 24 hours. The adventures that will be run this year can be seen here.</p>
                        <p>The players will bid/donate real money to take part in on of the adventures, with the highest bids/donations taking a place at one of the tables. It will need support refs as well as support from as many people as possible to make it as unique, special and worthwhile as possible.</p>
                        <p>On the day, if it is like our previous attempts, there will no doubt be a running commentary, photos, and a live stream to show the depths of stress we can get into as the night continues.</p>
                        <p>So, despite the fun we hope we'll have, it will most definitely be a feat of endurance, logistics, and skill.</p>
