Numenera is an RPG set a billion years in the future of Earth.

The past isn't important. What you do now is.

On this decade-long adventure, you'll try to make a safe home for humanity amongst the ruins of a hundred previous civilisations.

You are not likely to succeed.

Against you are the weirdest, most alien opponents that a billion years could bring to Earth.

You're not tough enough alone. 

But you might be tough enough together.

. . .

Pick Numenera for fantasy-sci-fi adventure focussed on making a community, building character and the weird of the world.
