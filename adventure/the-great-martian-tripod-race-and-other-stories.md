Franklin is the first human competitor in tripod racing history, but his team has hit a few problems.

His corporate sponsor is tied up in a hostile takeover bid, so the money has dried up. The Martian tripod racing clan is out to stop him, to keep tripod racing for Martians only. Who knows what dark deeds they will resort to?

As the members of Franklin’s race team, can can you overcome all obstacles and get him to the start line?

And that’s just the start. Win or Lose, there’ll be all sorts of ramifications which will take you across the Red Planet - from the British Colony of Victoriana, to the ancient Martian Cities, across the trackless red plains to face the Great Greed Horde of Martians. In a single night you’ll forge the future of a whole planet.

A game of Scientific Romance and Steampunk adventure, set on the Victorian colony of Mars.

Original scenario by: Martin Pickett

NOTE: The session will start with a “Session zero” a short - 1 hour-ish - adventure set in an Alternative Victorian London. This will familiarise players with the game system before they make their characters for the full game

(2d6, trindie, easy to learn, lots of opportunity for player agency, magic happens every time you roll a double.)
