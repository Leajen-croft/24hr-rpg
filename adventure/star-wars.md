The galaxy is protected under the might of the Empire. You've heard of this fledgling Rebel Alliance fighting against the Empire for a better galaxy for all. 

The thing is, you're not really bothered about all this drama. As long as you can make some money, live the life of freedom and not die if things go wrong then you are happy to let the Empire and Rebels fight it out. On the outer rim you are your own master.

Participate in an adventure  where morality is gray and nothing is certain. Explore the jungles of an Outer Rim paradise. Slice into the networks of an interplanetary crime syndicate. Fight your way onto a pirate ship. Battle a seasoned pitfighter while thousands of spectators look on â€“ all in pursuit of the nefarious, cunning, and powerful Pirate Queen. 

You never know what tough deals you'll make, what underground contacts you'll meet, or what illicit deeds you'll perform in this fast-paced bounty hunting adventure.
