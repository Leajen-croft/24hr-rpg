A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...

The Empire controls most of the galaxy. There are rumours of giant weapons that can destroy entire planets. The rebels are doing all they can to stop these weapons before it is too late.

This is a story that has been heard before though, lets hear about something different for a change.

On the outer rim a rag tag group of adventurers try to track down the infamous pirate queen. Little do they know of the problems they are soon to face.

A light-hearted adventure, that doesn't sweat the main goings on in the galaxy.

(Star Wars Edge of the Empire uses custom dice, these will be supplied as needed).
